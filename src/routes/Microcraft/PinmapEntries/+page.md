# > Pin Map Entries
---

A Pin-Map-Entry is an entry that can be mapped to a pin of a Microcontroller.
### List of all Entries
All currently supported entries are:
- no entries //TODO for later me: add entries (shout at me if I forget to add them when the first official version of the mod get's released and this is still not updated)

### Not supported Entries
If an entry is not supported by the mod it cannot be used natively. There are plans for a library that can be implemented into any mod to make any entry possible. This would open the doors to the implementation of any (even mod-specific) feature. BUT: Don't get too excited yet, it's only a plan.
