# Jonas_Jones API
---
This is the documentation on the public part of the Jonas_Jones API. 


Part of the API is opensource and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/J-onasJones/api-worker). That part of the API is a Couldflare worker and acts as a front-end of the different API endpoints that it serves. Only few commands are currently available since the API is in an early stage and most planned publically available commands haven't been implemented yet.
